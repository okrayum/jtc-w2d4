# W2D4 After-Class Assignment

## Objectives

### Configure Flask Web Server:
- Install Python and Flask on your computer.
- Initialize a Flask project.
- Set up the necessary configurations for a Flask web server.

### Hands-On Exercise: Expressing Your Interests through Routes with JS Integration
- Create routes within the Flask application, each representing a unique aspect of your hobbies and interests.
- Implement logic in these routes to provide information or details about each interest.
- Integrate JavaScript to enhance the user experience on specific routes.

## After Thoughts

I was a little nervous to start this assignment because of my lack of experience with the technologies used. After figuring a little of it out I really like using Flask with Jinja2. It seems really easy to integrate multiple templates for a seamless experience. I also discovered setting up code snippets in VS Code for boiler plate code. That will help me in the future.
